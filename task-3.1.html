                <h3>The University Campuses in Muzaffarabad</h3>
                <p>The river Neelum running through the Muzaffarabad city bifurcates the University of Azad Jammu & Kashmir into two parts i.e. the City Campus and the Chehla Campus. The City Campus is located in the heart of the city near the main business center while the Chehla Campus stands on the eastern bank of the river Neelum. One can contrast of the clamor of the downtown city life at the City Campus and the calm and serene atmosphere of Chehla Campus to match ones mood. At  night, the capital city of AJ&K presents a magical view. Overviewing from the top of a mountain, it offers an array of lights which captivates the viewer.</p>
                <p>
                    Looking a little away from the city center, the thinly scattered lights on mountains appear like stars and you feel, for a while, as if the sky has been turned upside down. The cultural life of the city is as varied as its landscape. As one walks through the city, this contrast becomes too obvious to notice.
